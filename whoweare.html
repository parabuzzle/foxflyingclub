    <h3>Who We Are?</h3>
    <p>
      The Fox Flying Club is one of the better kept secrets at the DuPage airport. Our club has been active since 1956 and represents one of the best dollar for dollar values in aviation. A key ingredient to our club's success is that we've always insisted on having modern, well-maintained aircraft with advanced radio and navigation avionics available at reasonable rates.

      But even more important, we tend to attract the kind of friendly, conscientious pilots and flight instructors who can open up a whole new world of information that makes your flying safer, more rewarding and more fun.

      A flying club is more than just renting airplanes. We try to make our club a bit different, with special events, interesting speakers, and flyins to unusual places. Our attention to preventive maintenance and continued modernization of aircraft and equipment is the way we keep rates low and value high. Our commitment to making flying more affordable, enjoyable and safer is the cornerstone for the Fox Flying Club.
